# GLAC(AAAI2023)

This is the MindSpore implementation of GLAC in the following paper.

AAAI 2023: A Generalized Unbiased Risk Estimator for Learning with Augmented Classes

# [GLAC Description](#contents)

1) Propose a generalized URE that can be equipped with arbitrary loss functions while maintaining the theoretical guarantees, given unlabeled data for learning with augmented classes(LAC). 

2) Propose a novel risk-penalty regularization term to alleviate the issue of negative empirical risk commonly encountered by previous studies.

# [Dataset](#contents)

Our experiments are conducted on six regular-scale datasets to test the performance of our GLAC, which are Har, Msplice, Normal, Optdigits, Texture and Usps.
